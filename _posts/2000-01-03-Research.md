#Capturing Conformational States

Understanding induced conformational changes at an atomic level is critical for drug development. We identify these conformational states using sparse experimental data from paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy.
We demonstrate this using our GPS-Rosetta approach on the example of the Dengue virus protease structure which can exist in two forms, a “closed” form in the presence of an inhibitor and an “open” form without inhibitor. 
Our approach succeeds in the structural elucidation of both forms while the traditional computational method fails.

#GPS-Rosetta

Paramagnetic ions attached to proteins via chemical chelating tags can act as GPS satellites. PCS of a nuclear spin from a paramagnetic metal ion ties its location to a certain isosurface,
a second PCS measured for the same nucleus from a paramagnetic ion attached at a different site restricts the spin to lie on 
intersecting isosurfaces. A third PCS measured from a paramagnetic ion attached at a site different from the first two would 
further restrict the location of the spin in space. This technique is analogous to the method of finding location 
on Earth from three or more GPS satellites. This method is incorporated into the Rosetta fragment assembly framework and dramatically alters the conformational sampling, 
directing the search towards the native. The GPS-Rosetta algorithm works with PCSs recorded in either solution state or solid state.
