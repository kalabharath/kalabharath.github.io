# Kala Bharath Pilla 

 I am currently looking for a job in industry in UK. I recently finished my  Postdoctoral fellowship with  **Prof. Andrej Sali** at University of California in San Francisco. <br>
 My PhD was in computational structural biology under the supervision of **Prof. Thomas Huber** at the **Australian National University.** <br>
 My thesis was on **"Protein Structure Determination by Paramagnetic NMR and Computational Hybrid Approach"**.<br>
 My research interests are in developing new algorithms for protein structure determination from sparse experimental data.<br> 

 My notable contributions:<br>
 **"DINGO-PCS"** : 3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by PCSs<br>
 **"DINGO-RDC-NOE"** : 3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by RDCs and NOEs<br>
 **"GPS-Rosetta"** : Protein Structure determination inspired by GPS algorithms.<br>
