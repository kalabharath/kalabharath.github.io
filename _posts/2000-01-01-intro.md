Currently I am a Postdoc fellow at the University of Calgary, working  with Dr Justin MacCallum.
I finished my PhD in computational structural biology under the supervision of Prof Thomas Huber at the Australian National University. <br>
My PhD thesis is titled **"Protein Structure Determination by Paramagnetic NMR and Computational Hybrid Approach"**.
I write and develop new algorithms/software for protein structure determination from sparse experimental data. Check out my publications and research for more information.
