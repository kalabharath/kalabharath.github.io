Currently **Alberta Innovates Postdoc fellow** at University of Calgary.<br>
My PhD is specialized in computational structural biology under the supervision of Prof Thomas Huber at the Australian National University. <br>
My thesis is titled **"Protein Structure Determination by Paramagnetic NMR and Computational Hybrid Approach"**.<br>
I write and develop new algorithms and software for protein structure determination from sparse experimental data.<br> 
My notable contributions:<br>
**"DINGO-PCS"** : 3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by PCSs<br>
**"GPS-Rosetta"**" : Protein Structure determination inspired by GPS algorithms.<br>
