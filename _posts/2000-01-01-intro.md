# Kala Bharath Pilla 

 I am currently working as a Computational Biologist at InstaDeep in London, UK. My previous roles include a Postdoctoral fellowship with  **Prof. Andrej Sali** at University of California in San Francisco and 
 a doctoral fellowship in computational structural biology under the supervision of **Prof. Thomas Huber** and **Prof. Gottfried Otting** at the **Australian National University** in Canberra <br>
 My thesis was on **"Protein Structure Determination by Paramagnetic NMR and Computational Hybrid Approach"**.<br>
 My research interests are in developing new algorithms for integrative/hybrid modeling of proteins and protein complexes and in protein structure prediction.<br> 

 My notable contributions:<br>
 **"DINGO-PCS"** : 3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by PCSs<br>
 **"DINGO-RDC-NOE"** : 3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by RDCs and NOEs<br>
 **"GPS-Rosetta"** : Protein Structure determination inspired by GPS algorithms.<br>
