# Kala Bharath Pilla 


I am currently working as a Postdoc with  **Prof. Andrej Sali** at University of California in San Francisco. <br>
My PhD was in computational structural biology under the supervision of **Prof. Thomas Huber** at the **Australian National University.** <br>
My thesis was on **"Protein Structure Determination by Paramagnetic NMR and Computational Hybrid Approach"**.<br>
My research interests is in developing new algorithms for protein structure determination from sparse experimental data.<br> 

My notable contributions:<br>
**"DINGO-PCS"** : 3D assembly of Individual smotifs to Near-native Geometry as Orchestrated by PCSs<br>
**"GPS-Rosetta"** : Protein Structure determination inspired by GPS algorithms.<br>{: .right}
