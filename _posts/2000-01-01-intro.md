#About

I am currently Postdoc at Australian National university with Prof.Thomas Huber.
I finished my PhD in computational structural biology, my PhD thesis titled **"Protein Structure Determination by Paramagnetic NMR and Computational Hybrid Approach"**.
I write and develop new algorithms/software for protein structure determination from limited experimental data. Check out my publications and research for more information.
