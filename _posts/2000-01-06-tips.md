## My dev setup.

My Desktop, workstation, laptop, phone and router are all powered by Linux. <br> 

Editor: Emacs (of course!) with [prelude][1] .<br>

IDE : [Jetbrains][2] professional IDEs, [Clion][3] for C++ and [PyCharm][4] for python. Free for academics.<br>

VCS : [Github][5]. If you are a student, grab the expensive [Github pack][6] for free. <br>
